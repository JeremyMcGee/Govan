Govan
=====

Builds .NET servers on AWS.

Given an XML server layout, Govan configures AWS server instances to match. 

TODO
====
It's early days for Govan, so there's nothing but a task list yet. 

- Create format for "environment manifest"
- What kind of "UI"? (I think a command line might be best - can then wrap with Jenkins etc.)
- Create first command: "apply" to apply a server layout to an environment
- Handle first layout element: "name" to apply a server name
- Und so weiter.
